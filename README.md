A simple To-Do webapp built from the ground up using Django. This project was my self taught goal of learning a bit about what a framework actually is and how it differs from a static webpage like my personal website.

Currently pretty barebones, as I am still relatively new to HTML, CSS, and frameworks as a whole.
